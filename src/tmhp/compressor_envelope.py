"""Compressor operating-envelope guard (pressure-ratio based).

The physically primary limit on a vapour-compression cycle is the compressor
**pressure ratio** ``PR = P_cond / P_evap``, not a fixed temperature lift: the
lift required to reach a given ``PR`` maps non-linearly through the refrigerant
saturation curve (Clausius--Clapeyron) and therefore differs by refrigerant and
operating level. A fixed minimum lift (e.g. 20 K) over- or under-states the true
physical minimum depending on conditions; a ``PR`` floor is transferable.

This module provides the shared envelope decision used by every heat-pump model
so the floor/ceiling logic and reason codes stay consistent. Each model owns its
own ``PR_cycle_min`` / ``PR_cycle_max`` attributes (user-configurable) and calls
:func:`check_pr_envelope`; the caller then **clamps** the floor (project the
cycle onto ``PR_cycle_min`` for a continuous low-lift transition) and **rejects**
the ceiling (outside the single-stage envelope).

References (see ``dT_and_Pr_cycle_min.md``): scroll axial-loading / built-in
volume ratio, oil-feed pressure differential, and isentropic-efficiency collapse
all place the floor near ``PR ~ 1.5`` (1.3--2.0 band). The ceiling default of
``PR ~ 10`` sits just below the AC-scroll hardware self-unload limit (~11:1) and
above the single-stage modelling boundary (~7--8); it is a sanity bound that
admits legitimate high-lift operation (e.g. domestic-hot-water boilers
condensing at 55--75 degC from a 0--12 degC source reach ``PR ~ 8``) while still
rejecting non-physical pressure ratios (Cuevas & Lebrun 2009; Bertsch & Groll
2008; Gayeski et al. 2011).

    Parameters
    ----------
    pr
        Compressor pressure ratio ``P_cond / P_evap`` (dimensionless, >= 1).
    pr_min
        Lower envelope bound (floor). Below this the scrolls unload / oil-feed
        differential and isentropic efficiency collapse.
    pr_max
        Upper envelope bound (ceiling). Above this a single-stage cycle is no
        longer representative.

    -------
    str | None
